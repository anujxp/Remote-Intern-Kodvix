# 🚀 Git & GitHub – Visual Guide
---

# 1️⃣ What is Git?

**Git** is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** that tracks changes in code.

It allows developers to:

* track file history
* collaborate with teams
* revert to older versions
* manage large projects

### Simple Definition

> Git is a tool that keeps a history of your project so you can track and manage code changes.

Example history:

```
Version 1 → Initial project
Version 2 → Added login page
Version 3 → Fixed login bug
Version 4 → Added dashboard
```

Git stores all these versions safely.

---

# 2️⃣ What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a **cloud platform that hosts Git repositories online**.

Git → works on your computer
GitHub → stores repositories on the internet

### Simple Analogy

| Tool   | Example        |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Git    | Microsoft Word |
| GitHub | Google Drive   |

Developers use GitHub to:

* collaborate
* share projects
* review code
* manage issues

Git works with **four main areas**:

1️⃣ Working Directory
2️⃣ Staging Area
3️⃣ Local Repository
4️⃣ Remote Repository (GitHub)

### Working Directory

This is your **project folder** where you write code.

Example:

```
project/
 ├── index.html
 ├── style.css
 └── app.js
```

You create or modify files here.

---

### Staging Area

The **staging area** is a temporary space where you prepare files before committing.

Command:

```
git add filename
```

or

```
git add .
```

Meaning:

> "These changes should be included in the next version."

---

### Local Repository

The **local repository** stores all committed versions of your project on your computer.

Command:

```
git commit -m "Added login feature"
```

This creates a **snapshot of your project**.

Git records:

* commit id
* author
* date
* commit message

---

### Remote Repository

This is the **online repository stored on GitHub**.

Command:

```
git push origin main
```

This uploads your commits to GitHub.

---

# 4️⃣ Real Life Developer Workflow

Let's understand what happens **in a real project**.

### Step 1 — Write Code

A developer writes code.

Example:

```
Added login form in index.html
```

---

### Step 2 — Check Changes

```
git status
```

Git shows which files changed.

---

### Step 3 — Add Files

```
git add index.html
```

or

```
git add .
```

Files move to **staging area**.

---

### Step 4 — Commit Changes

```
git commit -m "Added login form"
```

Now Git saves a **snapshot of the project**.

---

### Step 5 — Push to GitHub

```
git push origin main
```

Your code is uploaded to GitHub.

---

### Final Workflow

```
Write Code
   ↓
git add
   ↓
git commit
   ↓
git push
```

This is the **most common Git workflow used daily by developers**. ([LinkedIn][1])

---

# 5️⃣ Git Branching (Very Important)

One of the most powerful features of Git is **branching**.

A **branch** allows developers to work on new features **without affecting the main project**.

---

## Main Branch

The main branch is usually:

```
main
```

It contains the **stable version of the project**.

---

# Branching Concept

Imagine a project like this:

```
main
```

Now a developer starts a new feature.

```
main
   \
    login-feature
```

Another developer works on payment.

```
main
   ├── login-feature
   └── payment-feature
```

Both developers work independently.

---

# Creating a Branch

```
git branch login-feature
```

---

# Switch Branch

```
git checkout login-feature
```

---

# Create + Switch Branch

```
git checkout -b login-feature
```

---

# View Branches

```
git branch
```

Example output:

```
main
login-feature
payment-feature
```

---

# Merging Branches

After completing a feature, it is merged back to the main branch.

Example:

```
main
  ↑
 merge
  ↑
login-feature
```

Command:

```
git checkout main
git merge login-feature
```

Now the feature becomes part of the main project.

---

# 6️⃣ Collaboration Workflow (GitHub Teams)

In real companies developers follow this workflow.

```
1 Clone repository
2 Create new branch
3 Write code
4 Commit changes
5 Push branch
6 Create Pull Request
7 Code Review
8 Merge into main
```

---

# 7️⃣ Pull Request (PR)

A **Pull Request** is a request to merge your branch into the main branch.

Example:

```
feature-branch
      ↓
Pull Request
      ↓
Code Review
      ↓
Merge to main
```

Benefits:

* code review
* bug detection
* maintain code quality

             ▼
        git status
   (check modified files)
             │
             ▼
          git add
   (move files to staging)
             │
             ▼
       git commit -m
   (save snapshot locally)
             │
             ▼

   (upload code to GitHub)
             │
             ▼
        Team Members
          git pull
   (download latest code)
```

### Simple Explanation

**Step 1 — Write Code**

You create or modify files.

Example:

```
index.html
style.css
app.js
```

---

**Step 2 — Check Changes**

```
git status
```

This command tells you:

* which files changed
* which files are staged
* which files are untracked

---

**Step 3 — Add Files**

```
git add .
```

This moves the files to the **staging area**.

Think of staging as:

> preparing files before saving a version.

---

**Step 4 — Commit Changes**

```
git commit -m "Added login page"
```

This creates a **snapshot of your project**.

Git now records:

* author
* timestamp
* message
* commit ID

---

**Step 5 — Push to GitHub**

```
git push origin main
```

This uploads the code to **GitHub repository**.

Now other developers can see your changes.

---

# 2️⃣ Git Branching Diagram (Used in Companies)

Branching allows multiple developers to work on different features **without breaking the main project**.

### Basic Branching Structure

```
                main
                 │
       ┌─────────┼─────────┐
       │         │         │
       ▼         ▼         ▼
 login-feature payment-feature dashboard-feature
```

Each branch represents **a separate feature**.

Developers work independently on their branches.

---

## Example Development Flow

```
main
 │
 │
 ├── login-feature
 │       │
 │       └── commit changes
 │
 ├── payment-feature
 │       │
 │       └── commit changes
 │
 └── dashboard-feature
         │
         └── commit changes
```

After the feature is completed, it is merged into **main**.

---

## Merge Process

```
login-feature
      │
      ▼
 Pull Request
      │
      ▼
 Code Review
      │
      ▼
 Merge into main
```

This ensures:

✔ code quality
✔ bug checking
✔ team collaboration

---

# 3️⃣ Real Project Example (How Teams Use Git Daily)

Let's imagine a **real company project**.

Project: **E-commerce Website**

Team members:

| Developer | Task              |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Dev 1     | Login system      |
| Dev 2     | Payment system    |
| Dev 3     | Product dashboard |

---

## Step 1 — Clone Repository

Every developer downloads the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/company/ecommerce-project.git
```

Project structure:

```
ecommerce-project
 ├── frontend
 ├── backend
 └── database
```

---

## Step 2 — Create Feature Branch

Developer working on login creates a branch.

```
git checkout -b login-feature
```

Now the structure looks like:

```
main
  │
  └── login-feature
```

---

## Step 3 — Write Code

Developer writes login code.

Example:

```
login.js
loginController.java
loginAPI.php
```

---

## Step 4 — Add and Commit

```
git add .
git commit -m "Created login functionality"
```

---

## Step 5 — Push Branch

```
git push origin login-feature
```

The branch now exists on GitHub.

---

## Step 6 — Create Pull Request

Developer creates a **Pull Request (PR)**.

Workflow:

```
login-feature
      │
      ▼
Pull Request
      │
      ▼
Team Review
```

---

## Step 7 — Code Review

Senior developers check:

✔ code quality
✔ bugs
✔ performance
✔ security

---

## Step 8 — Merge into Main

After approval:

```
login-feature → main
```

Final project structure:

```
main
 ├── login system
 ├── payment system
 └── dashboard
```

---

# 1️⃣ Git Internals (How Git Actually Stores Data)

Many people think Git stores **changes**, but actually Git stores **snapshots of the entire project**.

### How Git Works Internally

Whenever you run:

```bash
git commit -m "Added login feature"
```

Git performs these actions:

1️⃣ Takes a **snapshot of all tracked files**
2️⃣ Saves it in the **.git directory**
3️⃣ Assigns a **unique commit ID (SHA hash)**
4️⃣ Links the commit with the previous commit

### Commit Structure

```
Commit
 ├── Commit ID (SHA-1 hash)
 ├── Author
 ├── Timestamp
 ├── Commit Message
 └── Snapshot of Files
```

Example commit log:

```
a7d93f  Added login feature
b72fa3  Initial project setup
```

Each commit is connected like a **chain**.

```
Commit 1 → Commit 2 → Commit 3 → Commit 4
```

This is why Git history is very reliable.

---

# 2️⃣ Merge Conflicts (Important Concept)

A **merge conflict** happens when **two developers modify the same part of a file**.

### Example Situation

Developer A edits:

```
login.js
```

Developer B also edits:

```
login.js
```

Both push changes.

When merging, Git cannot decide which code to keep.

---

### Conflict Example

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
console.log("Login Successful");
=======
console.log("User Logged In");
>>>>>>> login-feature
```

Meaning:

* `HEAD` → code from main branch
* `login-feature` → code from feature branch

---

### How to Resolve Conflict

1️⃣ Open the file
2️⃣ Choose correct code
3️⃣ Remove conflict markers

Example fixed version:

```
console.log("User Login Successful");
```

Then commit again.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```
